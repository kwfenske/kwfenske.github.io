<h3 id="icons">Icons</h3>
<p>The following icons are for Windows. Each icon has multiple sizes in a
single ICO file, which is downloaded inside a ZIP file. The icons themselves
are not compressed and should open in any icon editor, including "IconEdit"
listed in the next Java section.

<p class="item" id="size-test-icon"><a href="size-test-icon.zip">Size Test
Icon</a> (ICO in ZIP, 30 KB)
<p class="text"><img alt="size test icon 32x32 pixels" class=icon height=32 src="size-test-32.gif" width=32>Way
back when in Windows XP (2001), a big icon was 64x64 pixels. Now you need
256x256 plus 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and several more depending upon a system's
DPI display setting (usually 100% for 96 DPI, 125% for 120 DPI, or 150%). There
is no guarantee that Windows will use any given size, even if defined in an
icon file. Many will be scaled down from 256x256. Others will sometimes be used
and sometimes won't. This test icon has each size labelled with the number of
pixels, with sharp edges and an outline so you can see if Windows is resizing
from another size. Defined sizes are from 8x8 to 32x32 in steps of 2, from
32x32 to 64x64 in steps of 4, from 64x64 to 128x128 in steps of 8, and from
128x128 to 256x256 in steps of 16.

<p class="item" id="character-map-java"><a href="character-map-java.zip">Character
Map</a> (Java, ZIP, 1177 KB)
<p class="text">CharMap is a Java 5.0 graphical (GUI) application to
display <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> characters
or glyphs in text fonts, and copy those characters to the system clipboard. Its
major purpose is as a visual accessory for word processors such as Microsoft
Word. This Java application can be resized, for text and the program window,
which is important in many languages. Features are limited to make the
application faster and simpler to use. A single click adds a character to the
sample text, and the sample text is automatically copied to the system
clipboard on each click. The most recent <a href="character-map-data.zip">data
file</a> is for Unicode 17.0.0 (September 2025).
<p class="item" id="compare-folders-java"><a href="compare-folders-java.zip">Compare
Folders</a> (Java, ZIP, 322 KB)
<p class="text">CompareFolders is a Java 1.4 application to compare two folders
to determine if all files and subfolders are identical. The folders may be on
the same computer, on the local network, or they may be represented by checksum
files. Files or subfolders that are not the same are reported to the user.
Checksum files are used when the original files or folders are not available.
You may generate checksums for files and folders, and save those checksums in a
text file. You may compare two checksum files. You may compare a checksum file
and a folder of files. After you back up files to external media, and later
restore them, how will you know they are correct unless you have checksums from
the original files?
<p class="item" id="drive-speed-java"><a href="drive-speed-java.zip">Drive
Speed</a> (Java, ZIP, 229 KB)
<p class="text">DriveSpeed is a Java 1.4 graphical (GUI) application to test
the speed of disk drives or flash drives. Large temporary files are written
with all zero bytes, then read back. To get accurate results, files must be
bigger than the amount of physical memory on your computer (RAM), and should be
several times bigger, because your computer uses some of its memory as a "disk
cache" to increase the apparent speed of drives.
<p class="item" id="erase-disk-java"><a href="erase-disk-java.zip">Erase
Disk</a> (Java, ZIP, 273 KB)
<p class="text">EraseDisk is a Java 1.4 graphical (GUI) application to erase
and test disk drives
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive">flash drives</a>.
Large temporary files are created and filled with zeros, ones, or pseudo-random
data. Previously deleted files are overwritten. Existing files are not
affected. This cleans up an old disk before it goes in a new location. Don't
trust a new disk until you write data, then read to confirm. One complete test
is usually enough. (Repeated testing may degrade flash drives.)
<p class="item" id="file-checksum-java"><a href="file-checksum-java.zip">File
Checksum</a> (Java, ZIP, 241 KB)
<p class="text">FileChecksum is a Java 1.4 application to compute common
checksums for files:
CRC32, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5</a>, SHA1, and optional
SHA256 or SHA512. Checksums are small hexadecimal "signatures" for testing
whether or not files have been copied correctly, such as over a network. One
person sends a file along with the checksum computed on the original computer.
A second person calculates a similar checksum for the received file, and if the
two checksums agree, then the received file is assumed to be correct. Many web
sites provide MD5 signatures for their downloads; use this program to verify
files that you download. The MD5 for this ZIP file is
20f3cf21a3e1a88222f4e2477d3980e5.
<p class="item" id="file-redate-rename-java"><a href="file-redate-rename-java.zip">File
Redate Rename</a> (Java, ZIP, 249 KB)
<p class="text">FileDateName is a Java 1.4 graphical (GUI) application to
rename multiple files or to change their directory dates. The contents of the
files are not changed. Folders and subfolders may be searched recursively.
Changes may be applied to files only, both files and folders, or only the
folders.
<p class="item" id="find-duplicate-files-java"><a href="find-duplicate-files-java.zip">Find
Duplicate Files</a> (Java, ZIP, 218 KB)
<p class="text">FindDupFiles is a Java 1.4 application to find duplicate files
by searching for files that have the same size and the same MD5 checksum. It
won't find files that are merely similar, such as two consecutive photos of the
same subject, or two MP3 songs encoded at different times. Possible duplicates
are reported to the user, who can then verify that the files are identical,
either by inspection or by doing a byte-by-byte comparison with the "comp"
command on DOS/Windows or the "cmp" command on Linux. What to do with files is
the user's choice; the program does nothing except report the duplicates. The
probability of two different files having the same size and MD5 checksum is
extremely small. (Slower and stronger SHA256 version
is <a href="find-duplicate-files-sha256-java.zip">here</a>.)
<p class="item" id="font-rename-java"><a href="font-rename-java.zip">Font
Rename</a> (Java, ZIP, 282 KB)
<p class="text">FontRename is a Java 1.4 application to rename OpenType and
TrueType font files with their internal "font full name" using only plain text
characters (ASCII) plus an extension for the type (OTF, TTC, TTF), or using the
full Unicode character set in languages like Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean,
and Russian. This gives consistent names to font files, no matter what their
source. The contents of the files are not changed, only the names in the file
directory. Don't use this program on system folders with installed fonts. See
also: <a href="font-checksum-java.zip">Font Checksum</a>,
<a href="font-names-java.zip">Font Names</a>,
<a href="font-redate-java.zip">Font Redate</a>.
<p class="item" id="hex-file-viewer-java"><a href="hex-file-viewer-java.zip">Hex
File Viewer</a> (Java, ZIP, 242 KB)
<p class="text">HexView is a Java 1.4 graphical (GUI) application to display
the contents of a file in hexadecimal and as plain text (7-bit ASCII). Files
may be very large. Editing and searching are not supported. See
also: <a href="dump-file-java.zip">Dump File</a>,
<a href="hex-file-editor-java.zip">Hex File Editor</a>.
<p class="item" id="icon-editor-java"><a href="icon-editor-java.zip">Icon
Editor</a> (Java, ZIP, 301 KB)
<p class="text">IconEdit is a Java 1.4 graphical (GUI) application to
edit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_%28computing%29">icon</a> files
for Windows. An icon file has several images in sizes like 16x16, 24x24, 32x32,
48x48, and 64x64 pixels. Icons are square from 8x8 to 256x256 pixels. Colors
may be 4-bit (16 colors), 8-bit (256 colors), or 24-bit (millions). Pixels may
be transparent and let the background show through. Please note that IconEdit
is an old program and does not support alpha channels, compressed data (PNG
images), or icons larger than 256 pixels.
<p class="item" id="maze-fog-game-java"><a href="maze-fog-game-java.zip">Maze
Fog Game</a> (Java, ZIP, 242 KB)
<p class="text">MazeFog is an old Java
1.1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Window_Toolkit">AWT</a> (GUI)
applet to play a maze game. Your view is limited by a "fog" that shows nearby
positions and those you have already visited. Web

<p class="item" id="plain-text-java"><a href="plain-text-java.zip">Plain
Text</a> (Java, ZIP, 244 KB)
<p class="text">PlainText is a Java 1.4 graphical (GUI) application to convert
Unicode characters
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text">plain text</a> characters,
for example, to convert left and right quotation marks into plain quotes for
web pages. Since everyone has a different idea about what "plain text" means,
the conversion is controlled by a configuration file that can be easily edited.
The typical sequence of actions is to copy text from a Unicode-aware
application such as Microsoft Word, switch to this Java application, click the
"Paste" and "Convert" buttons, then copy the converted text to another
application that expects a more limited character set. Or create
a <a href="plain-text-data.zip">data file</a> that replaces non-ASCII text with
Unicode character numbers and descriptions. See also: Character Map (above),
Check Plain Trim (below).
