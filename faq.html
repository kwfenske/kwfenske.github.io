<p>These programs were written for my own use, cleaned up, documented, and
released to the public (GPL). They won't solve the big problems in your life,
but may help with smaller ones. I am often asked the same questions:
<ul><li>Why Java 1.4 and the GNU General Public License (GPL)?
<p>This was a reasonable choice in 2004 for applets and complete applications
with no dependencies. I should have switched to Java 5.0 when it was stable,
and maybe the Apache License with fewer restrictions. I do find
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generics_in_Java">generics</a>" in Java
5.0 and later to be ugly. Many of my design choices were for consistency in
projects over what became fifteen years. All of the programs run correctly in
Java 8, the current public run-time environment as of late 2021.
<p>The <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/">license</a> is difficult
to change. At least 200 files and 50 packages
have <a href="https://opensource.guide/legal/">legal</a> notices. Each package
would take a couple hours to rebuild (assuming no mistakes are made). There are
numerous tedious details. The web page applets can only be fully tested on a
clean copy of Windows XP or earlier. The BIOS date was 2008 for the last
computer here that could run the original development tools: Java 1.4.2 SDK,
Microsoft Word 2000, NetBeans 3.5.1 IDE, OpenOffice.org 1.1.5 (PDF generator),
Paint Shop Pro 5.03, etc. Too much history, not enough time.
<p>There is no perfect software license.
The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a> is good for end
users.
The <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License</a> is
better for bits and pieces that will be re-used. A dozen similar licenses
disagree.
<p>Permission is hereby granted to convert the web page applets to the Apache
License (version 2.0 or later) or to GNU GPLv2 from the original GPLv3 or
later. Applets are in the following five folders (repositories):
<a href="https://github.com/kwfenske/dots-and-boxes-game-java">Dots and Boxes Game</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kwfenske/life-game-java">Life Game</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kwfenske/maze-fog-game-java">Maze Fog Game</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kwfenske/reversi-game-java">Reversi Game</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kwfenske/tic-tac-toe-game-java">Tic-Tac-Toe Game</a>.
It is impossible to change the license without also changing the binary class
files, which can't be properly tested anymore. All others have been converted
to a dual license of Apache plus GPL. Yes, it really did take as long as
estimated above.
</li><li>Should these programs have more features?
<p>Having twice the features would require ten times the effort. Open-source
software does not need to provide all solutions for all people. You leave hooks
for expansion, and let other people make the changes.
</li><li>Why Microsoft Word 97-2003 format for the documentation (*.DOC)?
<p>The DOCX format didn't exist until 2007 and wasn't common for several more
years. The ODT or "Open Document" format also took a while to get accepted.
Documentation appears as plain text in the program source code, as a Microsoft
Word DOC file, and in Adobe Acrobat PDF format. The code comments will be
readable long after DOC and PDF files have become obsolete. Whether or not the
code itself will run is another question!
</li><li>Why GIF files for sample program images instead of PNG files?
<p>Again, because that's the way it was. GIF files were lossless, but limited
to 256 colors. JPEG files always have some compression. PNG files are now
better for screen images.
</li><li>Can you make the HTML index page any more plain?
<p>This is an index page on a web site for downloads of open-source software.
The page is fast, clean, and direct -- and works on almost all web browsers at
most font sizes. It even works with style sheets (CSS) turned off, which is
important for accessibility, and doesn't use JavaScript, which many people
disable as a security precaution. The more sophisticated a web page is, the
more easily it breaks.
</li><li>How many people visit your web site?
<p>I don't know. This is not social media where you rank yourself by the number
of followers. What is important is that people can download and use the
programs. When pushed for a number, I proudly report an average of zero point
zero visitors per day.
</li><li>Why two spaces between sentences?
<p>Old habits die hard. Another choice that stands out in hindsight.
</li></ul>
<h3 id="extended">GitHub Extended FAQ</h3>
<ol><li>Java Programming Language
<p>All computer programs are written in some programming language. Which one
depends upon what is available for the target machine. Java ran on multiple
operating systems (IBM, Linux, Macintosh, Solaris, Windows) and had
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">graphical
user interface</a> (GUI). Other languages had their
own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">application programming
interface</a> (API), some with short lifetimes. A desktop API was often
obsolete before ten years, a mobile API (cell phones and tablets) in maybe five
years. Then you rewrote for a newer API or a newer version of the same API. Old
Java programs had an unusually long lifetime of around twenty years. I wish I
could say we knew this in 2005, but it was just a guess. There is something to
be said for programs that have a single source file, no dependencies
(additional libraries), and stick to API calls as documented.
</li><li>Java Versions
<p>Several companies had strong opinions about the future
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> in
the mid 2000s, chief among them IBM, Oracle, and Sun Microsystems (the
originator). Java 1.4 Standard Edition seemed to be the only thing they could
agree on. The situation was somewhat unsettled until a year or two after Oracle
acquired Sun. Java 5.0 (2004) was good, Java 6 (2006) was not, and Java 7
(2011) was good again. Meanwhile, Java 1.4 programs keep running through to
Java 8 (2014) and later. Not bad for a language that has changed so much, I
don't recognize code from some newer versions.
</li><li>Packages and Installers
<p>My Java applications have around ten files for the program and a few more
for licenses and advice. The most common package is
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)">ZIP archive</a>:
everybody everywhere does this format. Great for people who know how to run
Java, but not for people who need an "installer" or setup program. Those,
unfortunately, are specific to each operating system. Assume you need one
installer for 32-bit Windows, another for 64-bit Windows, one for MacOS, at
least one for Linux, etc. A self-installer for Windows adds about 2 MB of
overhead. Say you have five distribution packages of 2 MB each for one ZIP file
that was less than 300 KB. That's 30 times more storage space and now you're
building a program five ways, plus the original ZIP. How many programs are on
my web site? Oh, dear. This is free, open-source software. I'm not getting paid
to do this, and any web host would be unhappy if I suddenly started using
gigabytes of data.
</li><li>Internationalization
<p>A long word
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization">supporting
many languages</a>. The more "international" you make a program, the dumber the
error messages get. I like good error messages. I only speak one language well,
so I can't personally translate program messages or documentation into another
language. On-line services such
as <a href="https://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a> come close when
dealing with straight-forward "declarative" sentences. Then you have to
implement message loading by language, generic substitution of parameters, etc.
To avoid too much work, you dumb down the messages -- exactly what I want to
avoid. Again, this is something you do if you have an interest in only one or
two programs.
</li><li>Non-Program Licenses
<p>There should be a better license for material that is not part of a program
package. Apache and GPL aren't suitable for this FAQ, the index page, etc. Yes,
I looked at other licenses. No, I'm not going to post negative reviews.

<h3 id="formatting">Formatting and Style</h3>
Books and college courses discuss the best ways of writing computer programs.
Read and learn. You will develop your own style. Some of my choices were as
follows:
<ul><li>Most lines are less than 80 characters (columns): a little too long for
straight text, too short for some code, and fits nicely on my monitor at a
reasonable size.
<p></li><li>Nested code is indented two spaces for each level. One space was
not enough and three spaces are too much. Left and right curly brackets line up
in the same column, unless the entire section is linear.
<p></li><li>End-of-line or "//" comments start at column 35 or later (after at
least one space). Bonus points if you know where that comes from. Hint: 10, 16,
35, and IBM System/370.
<p></li><li>White space is helpful, in moderation.
<p></li><li>Good comments will save you later when you have to revise your own
code. Write what you need to know about what you're doing and why.
</li></ul>
<p>A clean and consistent programming style is necessary for open-source
software. Bad code can be embarrassing for years to come. Bad documentation
makes even good code look like garbage. Proper grammar, spelling, and
punctuation are important: you can't communicate if people don't understand
you.
<ul><li>The text font, size, line width, and vertical spacing have the most
effect on the readability of documents. Try variations of each.
<p></li><li>My text is 12-point "Times New Roman" (TNR) with 10-point "Verdana"
for code samples. Editing is easier because almost everyone has these fonts.
Line spacing is 1.1 times normal height.
<p></li><li>TNR is smaller than most fonts, which makes the default word
spacing seem larger. There are two keyboard spaces between sentences. Some
argue there should be one space. Neither is correct. In good typography,
sentence spaces are different than word spaces: they are bigger, expand more,
and compress less. Word processors pretend to be good. Using the same keyboard
space for both sentences and words is a convenience that approximates
correctness.
<p></li><li>And for everything else, I remind myself with an old joke, that you
only know half as much as you think you do.
</li></ul>
